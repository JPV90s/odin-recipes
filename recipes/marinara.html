<p>
    Marinara sauce is a tomato sauce usually made with tomatoes, garlic, herbs, and onions. Variations include capers, olives, spices, and a dash of wine.
</p>
<p>
    Widely used in Italian-American cuisine, it is known as alla marinara in Italy, where it is typically made with tomatoes, basil, olive oil, garlic and oregano, but also sometimes olives, capers, and salted anchovies. It is used for spaghetti and vermicelli, but also with meat or fish.

<h3>Ingredients: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 ounces of dried spaghetti pasta (or other long pasta of choice)</li>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons of olive oil (separated)</li>
    <li>10 ounces of seafood marinara mix</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
    <li>½ onion (finely chopped)</li>
    <li>½ cup of white wine</li>
    <li>2 cups of tomato puree or tomato passata</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon of sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of fresh parsley (finely chopped)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps: </h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the package directions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 ½ tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the seafood marinara mix and cook for 2 minutes, turning occasionally, until just cooked. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes or until soft. Add the wine and bring to a boil. Cook for 2 minutes or until reduced by half.</li>
    <li>Add the tomato puree, sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or until slightly thickened.</li>
    <li>Return the seafood and any juices to the skillet and toss to coat in the sauce. Simmer for 2 minutes or until heated through.</li>
    <li>Add the pasta and parsley to the skillet and toss to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.</li>
    <li>Serve with more parsley if desired and enjoy!</li>
